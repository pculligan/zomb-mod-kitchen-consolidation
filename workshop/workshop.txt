Kitchen Consolidation
Fixes food fragmentation without breaking balance or immersion.

Safely combines leftover food
Lets you prepare small meat and fish pieces into usable piles
Works with stews and soups without changing vanilla balance
No free food, no buffs, no recipe overrides
What problem does this mod solve?
In Project Zomboid, food management often breaks down — not because food is scarce, but because it becomes fragmented.

You end up with plenty of food that’s technically edible, but practically useless:

Partially‑used cans cluttering your inventory
Many small or partial cuts that can’t be combined
Leftovers that don’t justify taking up a stew or soup slot
Cooking systems that punish variety instead of preparation
The result is busywork, not survival gameplay.

Kitchen Consolidation fixes that.

Important clarification
Many foods already support partial use — ground beef, butter, lard, and similar items work fine in vanilla.

Kitchen Consolidation doesn’t replace that behavior.

It fixes fragmentation under constraint:

Too many incompatible leftovers
Too few ingredient slots
Perfectly usable food becoming impractical to cook/add
What this mod does
🥫 Consolidate opened / partial foods
Combine opened cans and jars of the same food
Items must share the same freshness state
Empty containers are returned (cans, jars, lids)
Nutrition, freshness, and sickness are preserved conservatively
Result: fewer half‑cans cluttering your inventory.

🐟 Prepare fish into Fish Pieces
Fish fillets are explicitly prepared
Produces Fish Pieces, a fungible pile
Fish Pieces:
behave like ground meat
can be partially used
integrate cleanly into stews and soups
Raw fish remains dangerous until cooked
Result: small fish and partial fillets stay useful.

🥩 Prepare meat into Meat Pieces
Raw meats can be prepared into Meat Pieces
Works for:
vanilla meats
modded meats
containerized meats (e.g. canned ham)
Containerized meats correctly return empty containers
Meat Pieces:
are additive piles
scale by hunger (portion‑based)
work with stews and soups
preserve sickness and poison behavior
Result: meat preparation finally works like a real kitchen.

What this mod does not do
❌ No free food
❌ No nutrition buffs
❌ No recipe overrides
❌ No cooking shortcuts
❌ No “merge raw steaks into super‑steak”
❌ No early warnings about poison or sickness
If something is unsafe, it stays unsafe.
If something spoils, it still spoils.

Design philosophy
Kitchen Consolidation follows three rules:

Preparation is explicit
Nothing is merged automatically.

Worst‑case safety applies
Mixing food never makes it safer.

Vanilla systems come first
Stews, soups, nutrition, and spoilage all use base‑game mechanics.

This mod fixes friction — not difficulty.

Compatibility
Kitchen Consolidation is designed to be compatibility‑first.
It avoids recipe overrides, global hooks, and invasive patches so it can coexist cleanly with other mods.

How compatibility works
Vanilla‑first behavior
All consolidation and preparation logic builds on existing base‑game mechanics (hunger, freshness, evolved recipes).
Whitelist‑driven integration
Eligible items are defined via centralized source lists.
Container behavior preserved
Containerized foods correctly return empty containers.
Multiplayer and saves
Multiplayer‑safe (no server‑only logic or client‑only hacks)
Existing saves supported
(new item scripts require new item spawns, as with vanilla)

Planned expansion (not promises)
Future phases may explore:

additional mod compatibility
further reductions in food inventory busywork
more translations (by request)
Only if they fit the same philosophy.

In case of issues after updates
Quit the game
Restart Project Zomboid
Start a new save for new item scripts
Item definitions are cached by the B41 engine. I won't code this for B42 until multiplayer comes out and stabilizes a little.
