[h1]Kitchen Consolidation[/h1]

Fixes food fragmentation without breaking balance or immersion.

[list]
[*]Safely combines leftover food
[*]Lets you prepare small meat and fish pieces into usable piles
[*]Works with stews and soups without changing vanilla balance
[*]No free food, no buffs, no recipe overrides
[/list]

[h2]What problem does this mod solve?[/h2]

In Project Zomboid, food management often breaks down — not because food is scarce, but because it becomes [b]fragmented[/b].

You end up with plenty of food that’s technically edible, but practically useless:

[list]
[*]Partially-used cans cluttering your inventory
[*]Many small or partial cuts that can’t be combined
[*]Leftovers that don’t justify taking up a stew or soup slot
[*]Cooking systems that punish variety instead of preparation
[/list]

The result is busywork, not survival gameplay.

[b]Kitchen Consolidation fixes that.[/b]

[h3]Important clarification[/h3]

Many foods already support [b]partial use[/b] — ground beef, butter, lard, and similar items work fine in vanilla.

Kitchen Consolidation doesn’t replace that behavior.

It fixes [b]fragmentation under constraint[/b]:
[list]
[*]Too many incompatible leftovers
[*]Too few ingredient slots
[*]Perfectly usable food becoming impractical to cook or add
[/list]

[h2]What this mod does[/h2]

[h3]🥫 Consolidate opened / partial foods[/h3]
[list]
[*]Combine opened cans and jars of the same food
[*]Items must share the [b]same freshness state[/b]
[*]Empty containers are returned (cans, jars, lids)
[*]Nutrition, freshness, and sickness are preserved conservatively
[/list]

[b]Result:[/b] fewer half-cans cluttering your inventory.

[h3]🐟 Prepare fish into Fish Pieces[/h3]
[list]
[*]Fish fillets are [b]explicitly prepared[/b]
[*]Produces [b]Fish Pieces[/b], a fungible pile
[*]Fish Pieces:
[list]
[*]behave like ground meat
[*]can be partially used
[*]integrate cleanly into stews and soups
[/list]
[*]Raw fish remains dangerous until cooked
[/list]

[b]Result:[/b] small fish and partial fillets stay useful.

[h3]🥩 Prepare meat into Meat Pieces[/h3]
[list]
[*]Raw meats can be prepared into [b]Meat Pieces[/b]
[*]Works for:
[list]
[*]vanilla meats
[*]modded meats
[*]containerized meats (e.g. canned ham)
[/list]
[*]Containerized meats correctly return empty containers
[*]Meat Pieces:
[list]
[*]are additive piles
[*]scale by hunger (portion-based)
[*]work with stews and soups
[*]preserve sickness and poison behavior
[/list]
[/list]

[b]Result:[/b] meat preparation finally works like a real kitchen.

[h2]What this mod does [b]not[/b] do[/h2]

[list]
[*]No free food
[*]No nutrition buffs
[*]No recipe overrides
[*]No cooking shortcuts
[*]No “merge raw steaks into super-steak”
[*]No early warnings about poison or sickness
[/list]

If something is unsafe, it stays unsafe.  
If something spoils, it still spoils.

[h2]Design philosophy[/h2]

Kitchen Consolidation follows three rules:

[list=1]
[*][b]Preparation is explicit[/b]  
Nothing is merged automatically.
[*][b]Worst-case safety applies[/b]  
Mixing food never makes it safer.
[*][b]Vanilla systems come first[/b]  
Stews, soups, nutrition, and spoilage all use base-game mechanics.
[/list]

This mod fixes friction — not difficulty.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

Kitchen Consolidation is designed to be [b]compatibility-first[/b].  
It avoids recipe overrides, global hooks, and invasive patches so it can coexist cleanly with other mods.

Load this mod [b]after[/b] the mods it actively supports.

[h3]How compatibility works[/h3]
[list]
[*][b]Vanilla-first behavior[/b]  
All consolidation and preparation logic builds on existing base-game mechanics (hunger, freshness, evolved recipes).
[*][b]Whitelist-driven integration[/b]  
Eligible items are defined via centralized source lists.
[*][b]Container behavior preserved[/b]  
Containerized foods correctly return empty containers.
