# Purpose

Kitchen Consolidation exists to solve a specific, practical problem in
Project Zomboid’s survival gameplay:

> **Food fragments accumulate faster than they can be used.**

As the game progresses, players frequently end up with many partially
consumed food items that are individually too small to be useful, especially
in systems with limited ingredient slots such as soups and stews.

This mod addresses that problem without changing how food works.

## The Player Problem

In vanilla gameplay:

- Food is often consumed partially
- Cooking systems accept a limited number of ingredients
- Small remnants quickly clutter inventory
- Valuable calories become awkward or impossible to use efficiently

This leads to frustration, not difficulty.

Kitchen Consolidation targets that friction directly.

---

## Design Intent

Kitchen Consolidation is designed to:

- Restore usability to leftover food
- Reduce inventory clutter
- Preserve total food value exactly
- Respect vanilla balance and mechanics
- Compose cleanly with existing systems
- Never improve food quality (freshness, safety, or condition)

The mod does **not** aim to simplify survival or increase food availability.
It simply allows players to use what they already have.

---

## What This Mod Is Not

Kitchen Consolidation is **not**:

- A rebalance of food values
- A cooking overhaul
- A realism simulation
- An automation mod
- A replacement for vanilla systems
- A way to make food fresher, safer, or higher quality than it was before

It intentionally stays within the boundaries of existing gameplay.

## Guiding Principle

> **Make leftover food usable again, without changing the game’s rules.**

All design and implementation decisions in this mod are guided by that
principle.

Consolidation is strictly a convenience and slot-efficiency mechanic.  
At no point does it improve freshness, remove risk, or upgrade the underlying
quality of food items. Any consolidation result is always equal to or worse than
the worst input item.
