Fixes food fragmentation without breaking balance or immersion.

[list]
[*]Safely combines leftover food
[*]Lets you prepare small meat and fish pieces into usable piles
[*]Works with vanilla evolved recipes (stews, soups, salads, sandwiches, etc) without changing balance
[*]No free food, no buffs, no recipe overrides
[/list]

[h2]What problem does this mod solve?[/h2]

In Project Zomboid, food management often breaks down — not because food is scarce, but because it becomes [b]fragmented[/b].

You end up with plenty of food that’s technically edible, but practically useless:
[list]
[*]Partially‑used cans cluttering your inventory  
[*]Many small or partial cuts that can’t be combined  
[*]Leftovers that don’t justify taking up a stew or soup slot  
[*]Cooking systems that punish variety instead of preparation  
[/list]
The result is busywork, not survival gameplay.

[b]Kitchen Consolidation fixes that.[/b]

[h3]Important clarification[/h3]

Many foods already support [b]partial use[/b] — ground beef, butter, lard, and similar items work fine in vanilla.

Kitchen Consolidation doesn’t replace that behavior.

It fixes [b]fragmentation under constraint[/b]:
[list]
[*]Too many incompatible leftovers
[*]Too few ingredient slots
[*]Perfectly usable food becoming impractical to cook/add
[/list]

[h2]What this mod does[/h2]

[h3]🥫 Consolidate opened / partial foods[/h3]
[list]
[*]Combine opened cans and jars of the same food
[*]Items must share the [b]same freshness state[/b]
[*]Empty containers are returned (cans, jars, lids)
[*]Nutrition, freshness, and sickness are preserved conservatively
[/list]
[b]Result:[/b] fewer half‑cans cluttering your inventory.

[h3]🐟 Prepare fish into Fish Pieces[/h3]
[list]
[*]Fish fillets are [b]explicitly prepared[/b]
[*]Produces [b]Fish Pieces[/b], a fungible pile
[*]Fish Pieces:
[*]behave like ground meat
[*]can be partially used
[*]integrate cleanly into stews and soups
[*]Raw fish remains dangerous until cooked
[/list]
[b]Result:[/b] small fish and partial fillets stay useful.

[h3]🥩 Prepare meat into Meat Pieces[/h3]
[list]
[*]Raw meats can be prepared into [b]Meat Pieces[/b]
[*]Works for:
[*]vanilla meats
[*]modded meats
[*]supported containerized meats (e.g. canned ham)
[*]dried meats
[*]Containerized meats correctly return empty containers
[*]Meat Pieces:
[*]are additive piles
[*]scale by hunger (portion‑based)
[*]work with stews and soups
[*]preserve sickness and poison behavior
[/list]
[b]Result:[/b] meat preparation finally works like a real kitchen.

[h2]What this mod does [b]not[/b] do[/h2]
[list]
[*]❌ No free food  
[*]❌ No nutrition buffs  
[*]❌ No recipe overrides  
[*]❌ No cooking shortcuts  
[*]❌ No “merge raw steaks into super‑steak”  
[*]❌ No early warnings about poison or sickness  
[/list]

If something is unsafe, it stays unsafe.  
If something spoils, it still spoils.

[h2]Design philosophy[/h2]
Kitchen Consolidation follows three rules:
[list]
[*][b]Preparation is explicit[/b]: Nothing is merged automatically.
[*][b]Worst‑case safety applies[/b]: Mixing food never makes it safer.
[*][b]Vanilla systems come first[/b]: Stews, soups, nutrition, and spoilage all use base‑game mechanics.
[/list]
This mod fixes friction — not difficulty.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Kitchen Consolidation is designed to be [b]compatibility‑first[/b].  
It avoids recipe overrides, global hooks, and invasive patches so it can coexist cleanly with other mods.

Load this mod [b]after[/b] the mods it actively supports.

[h3]How compatibility works[/h3]
[list]
[*][b]Vanilla‑first behavior[/b]: All consolidation and preparation logic builds on existing base‑game mechanics (hunger, freshness, evolved recipes).
[*][b]Whitelist‑driven integration[/b]: Eligible items are defined via centralized source lists.
[*][b]Container behavior preserved[/b]: Containerized foods correctly return empty containers.
